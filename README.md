# project_portfolio
a project portfolio site for Nicholas Houghton

This will be an evolving project that I will work on and add on too for a while. my plan is for this to be a simple static site but eventually add a cms system and blogging capabilities.

# Tech Stack
I want to use the MERN stack for this project.

some notes for me to remember

## make sure node.js is installed using 

`nodejs -v`

## setup react app using

`npx create-react-app project_portfolio`


# Project summary

I want to create an app that will showcase all of the projects that I am working on and have worked on. It would also be good to have some general information on who I am. 
I could also add work experience, classes I have taken and their discriptions, extracuricular activities. There should be a way for we to add, edit, and delete projects, work experience, extracuricular activites, and the about section.
